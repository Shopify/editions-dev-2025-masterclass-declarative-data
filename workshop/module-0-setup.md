# Module 0: Setup

1. Create a dev store in the Dev Dashboard, including demo data
1. Install the latest Shopify CLI if you don't have it
  * `npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest`
  * **PRE-EDITIONS:** As of this moment, you should use `3.78.1` explicitly (not `3.78.2`)
1. Create an app with `shopify app init`
  * You should choose `Extension only` because it's faster
